\chapter{Goals}
This thesis will contribute to the dissertation of Hendrik Reiter, which is about Ecoscape as an edge computing simulator.

\section{G1: Definition of Requirements Catalogue}\label{goal-def-of-req-catalogue}
For developing a proper edge computing simulator, a set of requirements need to be determined based on the current state of art and in form of a catalogue.
This catalogue should include
\begin{itemize}
  \item Definition and range of metrics
  \item Definition of necessary and optional features
  \item Definition of simulator specific characteristics
\end{itemize}
The content needs to be clear and comprehensive so it can be used to easily and strictly categorize an edge computing simulator as proper or insufficient.

\section{G2: Advancing Ecoscape to a proper Edge Computing Simulator}
At the current state Ecoscape is a benchmark tool designed to evaluate deployed applications in the Kubernetes edge based enviroment with a focus on realistic faul scenarios and quantifiable scores.
Thereby, Ecoscape needs to be further developed to a proper edge computing simulator in the sense of the requirements catalogue from G1.
This includes on implementing missing features, metrics but also update existing characteristics of Ecoscape, so that the requirements are met.
