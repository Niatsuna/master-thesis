\chapter*{Abstract}
The rapid proliferation of Edge Computing demands robust and accurate simulation tools to model and optimize the complex interactions across the Edge-Cloud-Continuum.
This thesis addresses the pressing need for a structured evaluation of the current simulation landscape by presenting a comparative study of ten representative state-of-the-art edge computing tools, leading to the deduction of a comprehensive requirements catalogue.
This guide establishes a future-proof benchmark for evaluating and developing next-generation edge simulation tools.

Using this newly defined standard, the thesis conducts a targeted validation of Ecoscape.
The analysis revealed that Ecoscape satisfies nearly all requirements, demonstrating its high technical maturity, but lacked sufficient representative use-cases to fully showcase its adaptability to emerging technologies.

To address this gap and further validate its utility, this work introduces a novel, timely use-case: A Large Language Model (LLM) workload deployment across the continuum.
The integration and subsequent experimental evaluation of this LLM scenario successfully demonstrate Ecoscape's capability to model complex, resource-intensive and modern computing paradigms.
