# Ecoscape as a Validated Edge-Cloud-Continuum Simulator: An LLM Use-Case Integration and Comparative Study (Master's Thesis) (2025)

This repository is mostly the LaTeX files for my master's thesis.
The raw files for the PDFs are located at `/writing`.
The directory `/presentation` holds the slides for both presentations regarding this thesis.

Github actions compiles the raw LaTeX files and updates the PDFs in the release sections, so no local compiling is necessary for simple viewers.
