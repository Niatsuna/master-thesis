\section{G1: Advancing Ecoscape to a proper edge simulator}
Ecoscape at the current state provides a mean to evaluate deployed applications in the Kubernetes enviroment.
The goal of this thesis is mainly, by identifying missing characteristics and problems within Ecoscape, to advance Ecoscape to a proper, robust and efficient edge computing simulator that
is on par with other simulators that are deemed state of art in the edge computing simulation landscape.



The focus should lie on the prospect of an easy to use and correct edge computing simulator and the implementation of missing features that are deemed to be especially necessary.

\todo{It is a bit short ? Struggle how to further explain a goal which result is heavy leaning on research. That is the main goal, everything else are mostly questions (steps)}
