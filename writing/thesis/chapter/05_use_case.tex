\chapter{Use-Case: LLM Deployment}
In this chapter we cover the enhancement of Ecoscapes documentation by implementing an Large Language Model (LLM) use-case which serves as a ready-to-go example for other users.

This use-case does not only shows that Ecoscape can adapt to modern technologies and therefore is applicable in the future, but also that it can handle greater workload as LLMs tend to be resource intense processes.
We therefore do not focus on validating a specfic LLM, but answering the question if Ecoscape is capable of handleling LLM workloads in general.
