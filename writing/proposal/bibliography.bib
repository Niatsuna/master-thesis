abstract = {Many Internet of Things (IoT) systems generate a massive amount of data needing to be processed and stored efficiently. Cloud computing solutions are often used to handle these tasks. However, the increasing availability of computational resources close to the edge has prompted the idea of using these for distributed computing and storage. Edge computing may help to improve IoT systems regarding important quality attributes like latency, energy consumption, privacy, and bandwidth utilization. However, deciding where to deploy the various application components is not a straightforward task. This is largely due to the trade-offs between the quality attributes relevant for the application. We have performed a systematic mapping study of 98 articles to investigate which quality attributes have been used in the literature for assessing IoT systems using edge computing. The analysis shows that time behavior and resource utilization are the most frequently used quality attributes; further, response time, turnaround time, and energy consumption are the most used metrics for quantifying these quality attributes. Moreover, simulation is the main tool used for the assessments, and the studied trade-offs are mainly between only two qualities. Finally, we identified a number of research gaps that need further study.}

abstract = {Legend has it that Google deploys over two billion application containers a week. Hows that possible? Google revealed the secret through a project called Kubernetes, an open source cluster orchestrator (based on its internal Borg system) that radically simplifies the task of building, deploying, and maintaining scalable distributed systems in the cloud. This practical guide shows you how Kubernetes and container technology can help you achieve new levels of velocity, agility, reliability, and efficiency. Authors Kelsey Hightower, Brendan Burns, and Joe Bedawhove worked on Kubernetes at Google and other organizatons explain how this system fits into the lifecycle of a distributed application. You will learn how to use tools and APIs to automate scalable distributed systems, whether it is for online services, machine-learning applications, or a cluster of Raspberry Pi computers. Explore the distributed system challenges that Kubernetes addresses Dive into containerized application development, using containers such as Docker Create and run containers on Kubernetes, using the docker image format and container runtime Explore specialized objects essential for running applications in production Reliably roll out new software versions without downtime or errors Get examples of how to develop and deploy real-world applications in Kubernetes}

abstract = {Continuous integration enables the development of microservices-based applications using container virtualization technology. Container orchestration systems such as Kubernetes, which has become the de facto standard, simplify the deployment of container-based applications. However, developing efficient and well-defined orchestration systems is a challenge. This article focuses specifically on the scheduler, a key orchestrator task that assigns physical resources to containers. Scheduling approaches are designed based on different Quality of Service (QoS) parameters to provide limited response time, efficient energy consumption, better resource utilization, and other things. This article aims to establish insight knowledge into Kubernetes scheduling, find the main gaps, and thus guide future research in the area. Therefore, we conduct a study of empirical research on Kubernetes scheduling techniques and present a new taxonomy for Kubernetes scheduling. The challenges, future direction, and research opportunities are also discussed.},

abstract = {Abstract Edge computing is a fast growing field of research that covers a spectrum of technologies bringing the cloud computing services closer to the end user. Growing interest in this area yields many edge computing approaches that need to be evaluated and optimized. Experimenting on the real cloud environments is not always feasible due to the operational cost and the scalability. Despite increasing research activity, this field lacks a simulation tool that supports the modeling of both computational and networking resources to handle the edge computing scenarios. Existing network simulators can model the network behavior at different levels of granularity. The cloud computing simulators support the modeling and simulation of the computational infrastructures and services efficiently. Starting from the available simulators, a significant programming effort is required to obtain a simulation tool meeting the actual needs. On the other hand, designing a new edge computing tool has many challenges such as the scalability, extensibility, and modeling the mobility, network, and virtualized resources. To decrease the barriers, a new simulator tool called EdgeCloudSim streamlined for the edge computing scenarios is proposed in this work. EdgeCloudSim builds upon CloudSim to address the specific demands of edge computing research and support the necessary functionalities. To demonstrate the capabilities of EdgeCloudSim, an experiment setup based on different edge architectures is simulated. In addition, the effect of the edge server capacity and the mobility on the overall system performance are investigated.},
