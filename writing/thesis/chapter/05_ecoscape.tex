\chapter{Ecoscape}
With the previous chapter, we completed our first goal by deducting the requirements catalgue and will now apply it to Ecoscape.
In this chapter we first analyze Ecoscape's current state by revisiting its main components while comparing its implementation with the requirements catalogue, 
deducting our agenda of enhancements based on the outcome and then applying these enhancements.
At the end we evaluate the applied enhancements in comparison to the original version.
