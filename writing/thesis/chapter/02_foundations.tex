\chapter{Foundations}
This chapter establishes the theoretical, in form of conceptual foundations, as well as technical foundations, like the technical components that make up Ecoscape architecture, 
which are both essential for understanding the presented work in the following chapters.

The first section introduces edge computing fundamentals, including its defining characteristics, architectural models, and the challenges that necessitate simulation-based research approaches.
The second section explores simulation principles and methodologies, providing the theoretical framework for understanding how edge computing systems can be effectively modeled and evaluated.
Subsequently, the technical foundations section examines the specific technologies employed in Ecoscape.
