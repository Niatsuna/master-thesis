Figure \ref{fig:approach_figure} visualises the general approach of the thesis showing distinct steps to meet the goals of the thesis.
First the state of art is determined, which is neatly followed by an analysis to determine the requirements catalogue (\ref{approach:state-of-art}).
Then, Ecoscape is analyzed to have a comparable base to the content of the catalogue (\ref{approach:ecoscape-current-state}) and based on that comparison the implementation takes place (\ref{approach:ecoscape-implementation}).
At the end an evaluation of Ecoscape takes place (\ref{approach:ecoscape-evaluation}).
\\
In the following sections, each step is further described.
\section{State of Art and Requirements Catalogue}\label{approach:state-of-art}
The computing simulation landscape is vast with different simulators, which can have all different bias, metrics, implementations, use-cases, focus and features.
There are in general pure edge computing simulators, pure fog computing simulators and hybrid simulators that could have qualities that could potentially be important insights to our research. 
\ \\
To have a common ground, we firstly use literature review to compute a list of simulators that we deem representative for the state of art based on specific criteria.
For this we look at simulators which are highly cited and widely adopted as well as covering multiple paradigms, have contemporary relevance in recent research trends and show diversity in their research regarding niches and methodologies.

Based on these criteria, the following list of simulators can be determined and will be further elaborated in detail in the thesis:
\begin{itemize}
  \item iFogSim2 [\cite{mahmud2021ifogsim2extendedifogsimsimulator}]
  \item EdgeCloudSim [\cite{https://doi.org/10.1002/ett.3493}]
  \item YAFS [\cite{8758823}]
  \item EdgeAISim [\cite{Nandhakumar_2024}]
  \item MockFog 2.0 [\cite{Hasenburg_2023}]
  \item FogNetSim++ [\cite{fognetsimplspls}]
  \item EmuFog [\cite{8368525}]
  \item FogTorch [\cite{7919155}]
\end{itemize}
We further determine their respective quality characteristics, use-cases, focuses, approaches and architectures through said literature review and with further testing we gain a broader knowledge about each simulator in said list.
This testing can be done by running the simulators with the same use-cases and data and subsequently comparing the results. Regarding that, a few key points of \cite{pfandzelter2024lessonslearnedbuildingedge} should be studied and applied.
This gives us a good overview of the current state of art simulators and their respective strengths and weaknesses as well as their similarities and differences.
Based on the results of the literature review and the testing, we then can construct a requirements catalogue that defines the necessary and optional features, metrics and characteristics of a proper edge computing simulator.

\section{Ecoscape}\label{approach:ecoscape}
\subsection{Analysis of current state}\label{approach:ecoscape-current-state}
To advance Ecoscape, we firstly need to determine Ecoscape's strengths and weaknesses in comparison to the requirements catalogue. 
Therefore in a similar manner as we reviewed and tested the state of art simulators in section \ref{approach:state-of-art}, we need to review and test Ecoscape.
We then can compare the resulting points with the catalogue to determine the set of requirements that Ecoscape currently meets and some where it underperforms.
This gives us an agenda for the next step.

\subsection{Implementation}\label{approach:ecoscape-implementation}
Based on the result of section \ref{approach:ecoscape-current-state}, the currently good and bad points of ecoscape should be clear. This step therefore is focusing on implementing missing features as well as improving existing features 
to meet the requirements catalogue.
The implementation will be done part of the Ecoscape project and therefore should be good documented as well as steadily tested to guarantee satisfying results. 

\subsection{Evaluation}\label{approach:ecoscape-evaluation}
At the end, an evaluation takes place to determine if the resulting version of Ecoscape is meeting expectations. At this point the evaluation should take place over multiple use-cases and will be done via user study or expert interviews.
The exact parameters of said evaluation still need to be defined.
