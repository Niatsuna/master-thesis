# Systematic Analysis and Improvement of Edge Computing Simulators (Master's Thesis) (2025)

This repository is mostly the LaTeX files for my master's thesis.
The raw files for the PDFs are located at `/writing`.

Github actions compiles the raw LaTeX files and updates the PDFs in the release sections, so no local compiling is necessary for simple viewers.
