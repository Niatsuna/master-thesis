  abstract = {Many Internet of Things (IoT) systems generate a massive amount of data needing to be processed and stored efficiently. Cloud computing solutions are often used to handle these tasks. However, the increasing availability of computational resources close to the edge has prompted the idea of using these for distributed computing and storage. Edge computing may help to improve IoT systems regarding important quality attributes like latency, energy consumption, privacy, and bandwidth utilization. However, deciding where to deploy the various application components is not a straightforward task. This is largely due to the trade-offs between the quality attributes relevant for the application. We have performed a systematic mapping study of 98 articles to investigate which quality attributes have been used in the literature for assessing IoT systems using edge computing. The analysis shows that time behavior and resource utilization are the most frequently used quality attributes; further, response time, turnaround time, and energy consumption are the most used metrics for quantifying these quality attributes. Moreover, simulation is the main tool used for the assessments, and the studied trade-offs are mainly between only two qualities. Finally, we identified a number of research gaps that need further study.}

However, if based exclusively on Cloud Computing, the IIoT faces inevitable limitations and barriers. Therefore, in this paper we deal with the Edge Intelligence (EI), a novel paradigm at the confluence of Edge Computing and artificial Intelligence, and, particularly, we analyze its impact on the processing of the IIoT data in the proximity of the events of interest rather than on Cloud servers. Therefore, a general discussion on the most relevant benefits, limitations and open challenges of the IIoT-EI duo is proposed hereinafter and exemplified through an emblematic IIoT use case: this is related to safety-critical tasks based on video analytics and provides a full-fledged comparison between Cloud-and EI-based IIoT deployments (in terms of reliability, responsiveness, bandwidth usage, energy footprint and usability), finally outlining a general strategy for large-scale EI-aided IIoT systems engineering.}

Container orchestration systems such as Kubernetes, which has become the de facto standard, simplify the deployment of container-based applications. However, developing efficient and well-defined orchestration systems is a challenge. This article focuses specifically on the scheduler, a key orchestrator task that assigns physical resources to containers. Scheduling approaches are designed based on different Quality of Service (QoS) parameters to provide limited response time, efficient energy consumption, better resource utilization, and other things. This article aims to establish insight knowledge into Kubernetes scheduling, find the main gaps, and thus guide future research in the area. Therefore, we conduct a study of empirical research on Kubernetes scheduling techniques and present a new taxonomy for Kubernetes scheduling. The challenges, future direction, and research opportunities are also discussed.},

abstract = {With containers becoming a prevalent method of software deployment, there is an increasing interest to use container orchestration frameworks not only in data centers, but also on resource-constrained hardware, such as Internet-of-Things devices, Edge gateways, or developer workstations. Consequently, software vendors have released several lightweight Kubernetes (K8s) distributions for container orchestration in the last few years, but it remains difficult for software developers to select an appropriate solution. Existing studies on lightweight K8s distribution performance tested only small workloads, showed inconclusive results, and did not cover recently released distributions. The contribution of this paper is a comparison of MicroK8s, k3s, k0s, and MicroShift, investigating their minimal resource usage as well as control plane and data plane performance in stress scenarios. While k3s and k0s showed by a small amount the highest control plane throughput and MicroShift showed the highest data plane throughput, usability, security, and maintainability are additional factors that drive the decision for an appropriate distribution.},

  abstract = {The increasing popularity of applications with tight latency requirements has motivated research on Edge Computing, which positions computing resources near data sources at the Internet’s edge. Despite the emergence of simulation tools that make prototype validation less complex, time-consuming, and expensive, researchers and practitioners still face significant challenges when developing resource management strategies for the edge, as existing simulators fall short in providing a fine-grained model of edge applications provisioning. To overcome this challenge, we propose EdgeSimPy, a simulation framework written in Python for modeling and evaluating resource management policies in Edge Computing environments. EdgeSimPy features a modular architecture that incorporates several functional abstractions for edge servers, network devices, and applications with built-in models for user mobility, application composition, and power consumption that allow the simulation of various scenarios. Furthermore, we propose a novel conceptual model that accurately represents the entire lifecycle of edge applications and ensures seamless integration with real application traces. In addition to submitting EdgeSimPy to an in-depth verification that checks the simulator implementation, we discuss case studies that show EdgeSimPy in action in different large-scale scenarios.}

  abstract = {Abstract Edge computing is a fast growing field of research that covers a spectrum of technologies bringing the cloud computing services closer to the end user. Growing interest in this area yields many edge computing approaches that need to be evaluated and optimized. Experimenting on the real cloud environments is not always feasible due to the operational cost and the scalability. Despite increasing research activity, this field lacks a simulation tool that supports the modeling of both computational and networking resources to handle the edge computing scenarios. Existing network simulators can model the network behavior at different levels of granularity. The cloud computing simulators support the modeling and simulation of the computational infrastructures and services efficiently. Starting from the available simulators, a significant programming effort is required to obtain a simulation tool meeting the actual needs. On the other hand, designing a new edge computing tool has many challenges such as the scalability, extensibility, and modeling the mobility, network, and virtualized resources. To decrease the barriers, a new simulator tool called EdgeCloudSim streamlined for the edge computing scenarios is proposed in this work. EdgeCloudSim builds upon CloudSim to address the specific demands of edge computing research and support the necessary functionalities. To demonstrate the capabilities of EdgeCloudSim, an experiment setup based on different edge architectures is simulated. In addition, the effect of the edge server capacity and the mobility on the overall system performance are investigated.},
