\chapter{Foundations}
This chapter establisehs the theoretical and technical foundations essential for understanding the research presented in this thesis.
The scope encompasses both conceptual foundations of edge computing and simulation methodologies, as well as the technical compononts that comprise the Ecoscape simulator's architecture.

The first section introduces edge computing fundamentals, including its defining characteristics, architectural models, and the challenges that necessitate simulation-based research approaches.
The second section explores simulation principles and methodologies, providing the theoretical framework for understanding how edge computing systems can be effectively modeled and evaluated.
Subsequently, the technical foundations section examines the specific technologies employed in Ecoscape.
