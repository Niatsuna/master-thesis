# Ecoscape as a Validated Edge-Cloud-Continuum Simulator: An LLM Use-Case Integration and Comparative Study (Master's Thesis) (2025)

This repository features files for my master's thesis.

- `/ecoscape` features implementations, experiments and example files for the deployed use-case.
- `/notes` features mostly my notes from the start of the thesis
- `/presentation` features my slides for my proposal and my thesis presentation.
- `/writing` features the LaTeX files for my proposal and thesis

Github actions are used to automatically compile the raw LaTeX files and updates the corresponding PDFs in the release sections.
Local compiling is therefore not necessary for simple checking out this thesis.
